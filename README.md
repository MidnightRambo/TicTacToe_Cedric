# TicTacToe_Cedric
This is a tictactoe reository for P100. 
I know my Code is kind of dirty, but we've never programmed "games" before and it works. So i'll stick with it.
Both the .py and .ibynb file contain the same code

1. Choose in which row you want to make a play (allowed are numbers between 1 and 3)
2. Choose in which column you want to make a play (allowed are numbers between 1 and 3)
3. Win
4. Decide if you want a rematch or not (type "y" for rematch and "n" for no rematch)
